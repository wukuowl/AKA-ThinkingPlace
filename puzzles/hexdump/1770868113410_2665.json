  "question": "After a suspicious system crash, you are tasked with analyzing a 16GB memory dump to find the exact offset where a malicious payload was injected. The signature of the injector is known to be a two-byte sequence often hidden within a field of padding. Can you locate the hex values CF BC buried in the heap memory?",
  "hint": "Look for the anomaly among the uniformity."
