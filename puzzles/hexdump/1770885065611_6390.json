  "question": "You are deep within a volatile memory dump, sifting through rows of null bytes and repeating system patterns. Somewhere in the sea of repetitive instructions lies a corrupted pointer that triggered the crash. Your scanners indicate that the specific sequence of bytes marking the start of the compromised stack frame is represented by the hex pair 0B 27. Can you locate this specific sequence?",
  "hint": "Look for the anomaly among the uniformity."
