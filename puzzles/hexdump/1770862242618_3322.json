  "question": "The forensic team is sifting through a massive 4GB memory dump from a compromised server. The data is mostly filled with repetitive zero-padding and standard system headers, but a suspicious two-byte sequence at address 0x08FF2A interrupts the pattern. This sequence, represented by the hex values 75 and 6C, might be the key to identifying the shellcode's entry point. Can you locate this specific hex sequence within the dump?",
  "hint": "Look for the anomaly among the uniformity."
