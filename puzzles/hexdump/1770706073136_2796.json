  "question": "You are tasked with scanning a volatile memory dump from an isolated workstation that was recently flagged for suspicious outgoing traffic. The dump is primarily composed of repeating null bytes and recurring system headers, but a manual inspection suggests a unique signature has been injected into a segment of inactive kernel space. You need to locate the specific two-byte hexadecimal sequence that acts as the trigger for the dormant process.",
  "hint": "Look for the anomaly among the uniformity."
