  "question": "A cybersecurity analyst is performing deep packet inspection on a memory dump captured during a suspected exfiltration event. While the majority of the dump consists of repeating 0x00 and 0xFF padding, a unique two-byte instruction, 30 B2, marks the start of the payload's decryption routine. Can you identify the hex sequence that signals the beginning of this routine?",
  "hint": "Look for the anomaly among the uniformity."
